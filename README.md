# PingMoreLouderer
For World of Warcraft Retail

The new ping feature is fantastic, but the pings can be hard to hear in the heat of battle, especially when you have sound effects enabled.

This addon makes all pings louder and much easier to hear by playing the ping effects through the master volume channel.

This addon will also allow you to hear ping sounds whether you have sound effects enabled or disabled.

There are no options, all you need to do is install the addon. It just works!
